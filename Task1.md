"What is the most interesting thing I learned about money or finance this week, and how do I see it applying to my life or the world around me in 2025?"

	1 key factor/topic I enjoyed remembering and learning again about is Compound investing. Compound investing functions by reinvesting the profits generated from an initial investment to maximize future earnings. Compound interest earns profits on both the original investment and the accumulated returns. Unlike the simple interest, which is earned solely on the principal amount. Compound investing generates profits over time. And it continues to work as the money stays in the investment for a longer period. ‘This is what money works for you means.’ The most important thing for a person to understand and make the most of compound interest is to start investing at an early age (Time value of money). Even small, consistent contributions can lead to substantial wealth over time. The earlier one starts investing, the more powerful compounding becomes. 

	Compound investing is feasible to all, as one can even start with a small amount and increase with time. Looking forward to the upcoming years, I think compound investing is the key to making wealth for most of them, as market crashes or political conflicts can’t beat the money made from compound investing. I strongly believe and am following this principle to build a secure financial foundation. This method will help build my portfolio by investing in stocks, planning early retirements, and giving me financial freedom.
